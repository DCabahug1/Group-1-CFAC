CSUN Code For A Cause 2026 - ASLingo

Project Title: ASLingo

**Project Overview : ** Communication should be a bridge, not a barrier. For Deaf and Hard of Hearing individuals (DHH), navigating a non-ASL-speaking world often results in systemic isolation. In the modern day of universal AI access and tools, accessibility problems of the past should no longer bother us the same. Existing solutions often rely on expensive human interpreters or cumbersome written exchanges that lack spontaneity and speed.

In our mission to eradicate these problems of the past, we built ASLingo powered through AI innovation to bridge the accessibility gap people affecting the DHH community. By capturing signing in real-time and curated AI analysis, ASLingo functions as a digital tutor providing corrective feedback, ensuring users move beyond basic memorization toward a refined, professional command of the language. By transforming practice into real-time connection, ASLingo overcomes language barriers and blazes the path towards seamless dialogue that empower both sides of the conversation.

Purpose and Features : ASLingo is designed to dismantle communication barriers by equipping hearing users with the tools to learn, practice, and perfect their ASL. It reduces the "appointment barrier" by allowing for spontaneous, everyday interactions.

**Key Features:**

Dual-Layer Sign Recognition: Real-time image analysis with hand coordinates accessed and referenced through Mediapipe libraries & additionally reanalyzed through OpenAI integration.

Progress Report : Overall learning insights after each lesson guided to encourage and help users on their signing journey.

**Techstack :**

Frontend : React Native
Framework : Expo
Backend : Supabase
AI Models : GPT 5.2, Gemini Pro, Figma Make
